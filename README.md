# MS-Gradient
Cortical patterning of morphometric similarity gradient.

Welcome to the MS-Gradient package; a companion to our article "Cortical patterning of morphometric similarity gradient reveals diverged hierarchical organization in sensory-motor cortices".


# Software dependencies
FreeSurfer (tested with 6.0 - https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/)
FSL (tested with 5.0.9 - https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki)
Python (tested with 3.6)â€¨
MATLAB (tested on R2018a - https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)


# Preprocessing
Prior to using this package, it is expected that the individual scans have undergone recon-all processing with FreeSurfer.
Scripts to conduct diffusion map embedding in MATLAB could be found in https://github.com/MICA-MNI/micaopen/diffusion_map_embedding
